## Project Description
For my undergraduate thesis, I performed a behavioral experiment looking at graceful decorator crabs (*Oregonia gracilis*), using a methodology I designed myself. This project aims to organize and present my findings, methodology, and some of the literature I used over the course of this project.

## Goals and Intentions
This GitHub Pages site was created as a final project for the University of Washington course IMT 549 "Beginning Web Development". Some of my plans for creating the elements necessary to fulfill assignment requirements include:

### Have at least one subpage (*Week 3*)
Planned subpages, in no particular order:
* [ ] Copy of final manuscript
* [ ] About page for subject organism
* [ ] Bibliography
* [ ] Summary of findings and methodology (poss. separate pages)

### Create a grid of items responsive to small, medium, and large devices (*Week 4*)
Slightly unclear on what items should be gridded, but I'm thinking about making my homepage a grid of icons leading to the various subpages. Otherwise, my list of items is my bibliography.

### Be styled with a CSS framework such as Bootstrap (*Week 5*)
I looked at Bootstrap's documentation once and it made my entire brain glaze over, but it is the most popular CSS framework. Thinking of going with either it or [Bulma](https://bulma.io).

### Display a list of items from a JavaScript array (*Week 6*) and have a search and filter dropdown for said list (*Week 7*)
* [ ] Create a list of bibliographic citations
* [ ] Attach data to citations so they can be filtered (species examined, date published, topic?)

If the list has to be the same one that was made into a grid, that's also doable.

### Pull information from an API (if possible) (*Week 8*)
Both the [World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)](http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice) and the [Encyclopedia of Life (EOL)](https://eol.org/docs/what-is-eol/data-services) have APIs for pulling taxonomic and biological data about various marine species, which could be included on the page describing my subject species.

### Additional JS functionality (*Week 9*)
TBD
